# WindowsDefenderFirewallICMPBlock
Blocking ICMP pings on Windows Defender Firewall &amp; any TCP/UDP port.

Control Panel > System & Security > Windows Defender & Firewall (Settings could be used by another software ex: Antivirus), but you can create a new rule either program or port TCP/UDP to allow or block in this case let's create a ICMP block.
